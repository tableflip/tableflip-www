        <h1>Test the ideas</h1>
        <p><strong><em>Ideas are king, but not all of them are royalty material.</em></strong></p>
        <p>Still, it's important to find out. You really don't know what kind of idea you've got until it's been tested. TABLEFLIP encourages a creative working relationship where all the things are tried out to see what works best.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.</p>
          <p>Arthur C. Clarke, "Profiles of The Future", 1961</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Stuff that doesn't work gets pruned and you're left with an awesome simple thing that does something new and interesting.</p>
        <p>What if you could ship a thing after a week? How about every week? Well, this is what tableflip does...and then you can change direction of the project, reprioritise, or continue with the plan.</p>

        <h2>NodeBots</h2>
        <p>TABLEFLIP co-organise <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NodeBots-of-London">NodeBots of London</a>; introducing robots to JavaScript, via humans.</p>
        <div class="full">
          <p>We built the <a href="https://github.com/tableflip/nodebot-workshop"><code>nodebot-workshop</code></a>, to get people up and running with <code>johnny-five</code>, <i>the</i> Node.js library for communicating with hardware. The workshop is part of the <a href="http://nodeschool.io">nodeschool syllabus</a>; a step-by-step series of code challenges that introduce the components and code used to bring hardware to life.</p>
          <p>For <a href="http://lxjs.org">LXJS</a> we teamed up with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Nodebots-Paris">Les NodeBots de Paris</a> to build the <a href="https://github.com/tableflip/lasercat-workshop/blob/master/README.md"><code>lasercat-workshop</code></a> a <a href="https://storify.com/gorhgorh/lxjs-catbot">fun introduction to hardware, lasers, and internet controllable cat entertainment.</a></p>
          <p>TABLEFLIP built the new <a href="http://nodebots.io/">nodebots website</a> and were invited to <a href="http://nodeconf.com/">NodeConf</a> 2014 in San Francisco to run the hardware workshop.</p>
          <p>For <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NodeBots-of-London/events/194172342/">NodeBots day 2014</a>, with the wizard skills of <a href="https://twitter.com/achingbrain">Alex Potsides</a> we created a extra special meet-up where attendees <a href="https://github.com/tableflip/footballbot-workshop/blob/master/README.md">built their own bluetooth powered, laser cut robot vehicles.</a></p>

        <h2>KitMapper</h2>
        <p>TABLEFLIP worked with KitMapper to design &amp; build a peer-to-peer audiovisual equipment rental service.</p>
        <div class="full">
          <p>The KitMapper team came to us with an idea: an app that let people rent out unused audiovisual equipment to people who had a use for it.</p>
          <p>We worked out the details with them and delivered a functional prototype, then we built on that prototype over the next few months until they had a product that was ready for launch.</p>
          <p>The site is a single-page webapp designed so that it can be repackaged as a native mobile app. It features map-based search, user verification and a chat system, all built on top of that original prototype - and we're still working with KitMapper to make it even better.</p>

        <div class="full">
          <p>In collaboration with Chris Waring of wwaves, TABLEFLIP took their Meteor knowledge and built a web and NFC based solution for conferences and festivals to gain insight and info on their event, in realtime.</p>

          <p>DRIIFT is built as a Meteor web application and a Cordova phone app. It uses the latest NFC technology at it's base. We've been seen at tech events such as <a href="http://devslovebacon.com/">bacon conf</a>, <a href="http://2014.lxjs.org/">LXJS</a> and <a href="http://container.camp/">Container Camp</a>.</p>

          <p>TABLEFLIP was tasked with re-skining their aging Java applet based web application to give it a new lease of life. We worked closely with the backend team to integrate a new look and feel and port the features of the applet to a new, modern, <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">LeafletJS</a> based map. We made use of the latest web technologies such as websockets and CSS3 animations whilst also ensuring the application was useable on mobile devices.</p>

          <p>TABLEFLIP also built their main website and their newest product to hit the financial market <a href="http://purpletrac.polestarglobal.com">PurpleTRAC</a>.</p>

          <p>Meteor have contracted TABLEFLIP on a number of occasions to build various internal as well as external projects. Our most recent collaboration was on the "Meteor Now" campaign website, which aimed to raise $25,000 for <a href="http://codenow.org/">CodeNow</a> - a nonprofit focused on teaching under-represented youth to code.</p>

          <p>TABLEFLIP recently started running <a href="http://www.meteorlondon.com/">Meteor training</a> for javascript developers and beginners, aiming to introduce building web apps with Meteor.</p>

          <p>The first training day was a great success, we had around 10 students and also teamed up with <a href="http://www.ladieswhocode.com/">Ladies who Code</a> to offer a scholorship place.</p>
