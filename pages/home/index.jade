            p Having worked with many startups and entrepreneurs we have distilled a way of working that really suits creative innovation. 
              | Come to us with your idea and talk us through it. 
              | We prepare a workplan that takes the form of a 5 day sprint. 
              | At the end of the sprint you will have something live, to visit or download to your phone; something to test and put in front of your users.
            p Based on your feedback, we then work together to define the most important thing for the next workplan. 
              strong Plan. Build. Review.
              |  By repeating this simple pattern we can take you from idea to new business in a matter of weeks.
